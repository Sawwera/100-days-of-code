**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started out planning what I am going to learn in the next 100 days. First, I am a newbie to coding and I have a strong interest in building web apps. SO, I need to have a strong foundation of the web development. I am going to learn the HTML and CSS from scratch. I am going to spend the next 2 days learning about HTML and CSS. Then I will start to explore the frontend; Javascript.
